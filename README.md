# Restaurant Reviews App—Stage 1
The **Restaurant Reviews App—Stage 1** is a project of the Grow with Google Front-End Nanodegree Program, which contains the starter code for all Udacity students (FEND).

## Project Overview: Stage 1
The project was converted to a mobile-ready web application. The design of the project was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
A service worker was added to providing offline access.

## Instruction

1. The user download or clone ZIP of repository on the local machine.
2. The user needs a MapBox API key. Replace <your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>inside of main.js and restaurant_info.js with key. MapBox API is free to use, without providing any payment information.
3. The user needs to use a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on the local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this. Run command  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (if  version is Python 2.x,) or `python3 -m http.server 8000` (if version of Pyton 3.x).
4. The user visits the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
